#### This repository is for learning the object oriented part of cpp

### Theory:
* Errors- compile time – run time error
* C++ - case sensitive
* IDE – Itegrated development environment
* Iostream – input output stream
* Access modifiers – private, public and protected
* Object oriented- to represent real life objects and explain them to computer- many attributes or characteristics of the objects like car and methods or behaviour can be explained
* Class are user defined data type similar to int, float etc.
* Class Employee{ 
    }; - semiclone expected 
* Std::string, a data type from <iostream> library
