# learning_cpp
#### This repository is for learning the object oriented part of cpp
#### Most of the explaination is given inside of the programs comments themselves

### Theory:
* Errors- compile time – run time error
* C++ - case sensitive
* IDE – Itegrated development environment
* Iostream – input output stream
* Access modifiers – private, public and protected
* Object oriented- to represent real life objects and explain them to computer- many attributes or characteristics of the objects like car and methods or behaviour can be explained
* Class are user defined data type similar to int, float etc.
* Class Employee{ 
    }; - semiclone expected 
* Std::string, a data type from <iostream> library

### steps:
1. Learning classes and objects- classes_objects.cpp
2. Learning access modifiers and methods - access_modifiers.cpp
3. Learning constructors - constructors.cpp
4. Learning encapsulation - encapsulation.cpp




### usefull commands:
1. using std::sting :- to avoid typing std evertime before string
